# Self-Driving-Car
Project Overview

Thoroughly read the project requirements and objectives to understand the scope: Implementing Face Detection and Recognition using Python, OpenCV, and Machine Learning.
Environment Setup

Prepared the environment by ensuring Python (version 3.x) was installed.
Installed the OpenCV library via pip for image processing and computer vision tasks.
Research and Learning

Studied various face detection algorithms, including Haar cascades, SSD, and YOLO.
Refreshed understanding of Machine Learning concepts such as supervised learning, classification, and feature extraction.
Data Collection and Preprocessing

Gathered a dataset of facial images from public sources or generated synthetic data using DLib or OpenCV.
Preprocessed the dataset by resizing images, converting them to grayscale, and ensuring format and quality consistency.
Model Development

Created a Python project directory and initialized necessary files and folders.
Implemented face detection algorithm using OpenCV, experimenting with different techniques and parameters.
Optionally trained a face recognition model using Machine Learning techniques like SVM or CNN on the labeled dataset.
Integration and Testing

Integrated face detection and recognition components into a cohesive system, ensuring smooth interaction.
Thoroughly tested the model's performance using training and separate test datasets.
Evaluated metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to assess effectiveness.
Methodology and Techniques Used in the Project

For training data collection, acquired diverse facial data to ensure comprehensive training.
For algorithm selection, chose effective algorithms for accurate detection.
For model training, trained the model on large datasets for optimal performance.
By following these steps, I successfully implemented the Face Detection and Recognition project using Python, OpenCV, and Machine Learning techniques.
